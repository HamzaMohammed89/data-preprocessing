# data-preprocessing
A flexible JavaScript data preprocessing library for cleaning datasets. Features include removing constant and duplicate columns, filtering columns based on numeric content, and dropping highly correlated features with configurable thresholdsâ€”ideal for preparing data for analysis and machine learning. It provides easy-to-use functions for:

    âœ… Handling missing values (imputation or row/column removal)
    âœ… Removing duplicate records
    âœ… Detecting & dropping highly correlated columns
    âœ… Scaling and normalizing numerical data
    âœ… Encoding categorical variables

ðŸ’¡ Perfect for developers working with structured datasets in JavaScript/Node.js.

### ðŸ”§ Preprocessing Configuration Options

The data preprocessing utility provides configurable options to clean and optimize your dataset before analysis or machine learning tasks. Below is a detailed explanation of each supported option:

---

#### âœ… `numeric_threshold` (default: `0.7`)

Specifies the **minimum percentage of numeric values required** for a column to be treated as a numeric feature.
Columns that do not meet this threshold will be considered non-numeric and may be excluded from numeric-only operations (like correlation analysis).

* **Type:** `number` (between 0 and 1)
* **Example:** If `numeric_threshold = 0.7`, a column must have at least 70% numeric entries to be retained as numeric.

---

#### âœ… `remove_constant_columns` (default: `true`)

Enables automatic removal of **constant columns** â€” i.e., columns where all values are the same or contain only one unique value.

* Such columns add no predictive power or variability and are usually safe to discard.
* **Recommended** for almost all preprocessing pipelines.

---

#### âœ… `remove_duplicate_columns` (default: `true`)

Enables removal of columns that are **exact duplicates** of each other.

* These columns are redundant and can inflate dimensionality without providing extra information.
* The utility detects and removes one copy from each duplicate group.

---

#### âœ… `remove_correlated_columns` (default: `true`)

Activates the detection and removal of **highly correlated features** (based on Pearson correlation).

* Helps reduce multicollinearity and model overfitting.
* Particularly useful when training models that assume feature independence (e.g., linear regression).

---

#### âœ… `correlation_coefficient_magnitude` (default: `0.8`)

Defines the **threshold for high correlation** between pairs of numeric columns.
If the **absolute value** of the Pearson correlation coefficient between two columns exceeds this threshold, one of them will be removed.

* **Type:** `number` (between `0` and `1`)
* **Example:** If `correlation_coefficient_magnitude = 0.8`, any pair of columns with correlation > `0.8` or < `-0.8` will be considered redundant.

### ðŸ”„ Example Configuration

```js
preprocessDataset(data, {
  numeric_threshold: 0.7,
  remove_constant_columns: true,
  remove_duplicate_columns: true,
  remove_correlated_columns: true,
  correlation_coefficient_magnitude: 0.8
});
```

This setup will:

* Keep only numeric columns with â‰¥ 70% numeric values
* Drop constant and duplicate columns
* Drop one of each pair of columns that are â‰¥ 80% correlated
